description: "Choose between KMS Cloud or a self-managed deployment"
---

KMS can be used in two ways: via [KMS Cloud](https://kms.hanzo.ai), a managed offering, or through a self-hosted deployment within your own infrastructure.

Both options provide the same core platform capabilities. The decision depends on your operational model, trust boundaries, and compliance requirements. While KMS Cloud comes with built-in security and operational guarantees, a self-hosted deployment gives you full control—but also full responsibility for securing and maintaining the system.

## KMS Cloud

KMS Cloud is our managed service found at [app.kms.hanzo.ai](https://kms.hanzo.ai). It includes automated updates, availability guarantees, and secure infrastructure operations.

For most teams, KMS Cloud is the recommended way to get started. It simplifies adoption by removing the need to manage deployment, scaling, or maintenance internally.

Use this if:

- You prefer not to operate infrastructure or handle upgrades
- You require a secure, production-grade hosted service
- You want to adopt KMS with minimal operational overhead

<Info>
  <p>
    By default, KMS Cloud is a secure, multi-tenant service. For
    enterprises with stricter isolation or regulatory needs, dedicated cloud
    instances are available.

## Self-Hosted KMS

KMS can also be deployed and managed within your own infrastructure. This approach provides full control over platform configuration, data storage, and operational security. In this model, your team is responsible for maintaining uptime, monitoring, patching, and integrations.

Use this if:

- You require complete control over data, deployment, and security posture
- Your compliance model mandates self-managed or on-premise systems
- You need to tightly integrate with internal tooling and infrastructure

KMS supports multiple deployment methods, including [Docker](/self-hosting/deployment-options/standalone-kms), [Docker Compose](/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose), [Kubernetes](/self-hosting/deployment-options/kubernetes-helm), and [Linux package](/self-hosting/deployment-options/native/linux-package/installation).

To learn more, refer to the [self-hosting documentation](/self-hosting/overview).
