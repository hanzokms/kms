While most features in KMS are free to use, others are paid and require purchasing an enterprise license to use them.

This guide walks through how you can use these paid features on a self-hosted instance of KMS.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Purchase a license">
        Start by either signing up for a free demo [here](https://kms.hanzo.ai/schedule-demo) or contacting sales@kms.hanzo.ai to purchase a license.

        Once purchased, you will be issued a license key.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Activate the license">
        Set your license key as the value of the **LICENSE_KEY** environment variable within your KMS instance.

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Regular License">
            - Assign the issued license key to the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable in your KMS instance.

            - Your KMS instance will need to communicate with the KMS license server to validate the license key.
            If you want to limit outgoing connections only to the KMS license server, you can use the following IP addresses: `13.248.249.247` and `35.71.190.59`

            <Note>
                Ensure that your firewall or network settings allow outbound connections to these IP addresses to avoid any issues with license validation.
            </Note>
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Offline License">
            - Assign the issued offline license key to the `LICENSE_KEY` environment variable in your KMS instance.

            - The system will automatically detect that it's an offline license based on the key format.

            <Note>
                While the LICENSE_KEY_OFFLINE environment variable continues to be supported for compatibility with existing configurations, we recommend transitioning to LICENSE_KEY for all license types going forward.
            </Note>
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        Once your instance starts up, the license key will be validated and you'll be able to use the paid features.
        However, when the license expires, KMS will continue to run, but EE features will be disabled until the license is renewed or a new one is purchased.
    </Step>
